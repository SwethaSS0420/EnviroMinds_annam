Soil images vary greatly in lighting. CLAHE helps enhance texture features.\n2. Data augmentation increases diversity and reduces class imbalance issues.\n3. EfficientNet-B3 provides a great trade-off between speed and accuracy.\n4. Cross-validation and ensemble models improve reliability and generalization.\n5. F1 score was prioritized to handle skewed class distribution better than accuracy alone.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## GitHub\nhttps://github.com/SwethaSS0420/Soil-Classification---1-EnviroMinds-/tree/main/challenge-1","metadata":{}}]}
