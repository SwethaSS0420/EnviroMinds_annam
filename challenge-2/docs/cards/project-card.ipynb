The main challenge is that the training dataset contains only positive examples (soil images), while the test set contains a mix of soil and non-soil images, making this an anomaly detection problem.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Technologies\nPython, PyTorch, EfficientNet-B3, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Key Features:\n1.
